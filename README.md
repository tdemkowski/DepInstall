# DepInstall
My work is in src/mycode/DepInstall.java

To see AllTest.java's JUnit tests & DepInstall.java example (given by running):
(1) Unzip samples.zip in a directory of your choice
(2) In AllTest.java , edit line 15's string with (1) directory. For example:
      String PATH = "C:/Users/User/Desktop/resumePROJECTS/depinstalltest/";
(3) In DepInstall.java , edit line 632's as done in (2)
(4) Run both AllTest.java & DepInstall.java
